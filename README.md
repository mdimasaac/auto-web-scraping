# auto-web-scraping: how to open the files

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook File "Trader Joe's.ipynb"
2. Download the chromedriver.exe
3. put them in the same directory, copy the directory
4. open Trader Joe's.ipynb, paste your own file directory where you saved both of the files above to the line 34, see below:
5. driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path = 'C:\\Users\\mdima\\Desktop\\Python Learning Files\\02\\chromedriver.exe', options = option1)
6. run the file. let it open your chrome browser and let it do the work. make sure not to disturb the work by clicking, zooming or scrolling at the working window
7. the work runs for a few while. It ends with creating a csv file as well as an excel file. If you see these 2 files, the work's done
8. in case something's not working, chances are you need to install some stuff to make the script work. see the first 9 lines
